However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, Message Threads, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. </span><span class="c8">When you send or receive messages, we also temporarily collect, process and store the contents of those messages (such as texts, videos, captions and/or Message Threads) on our servers. The contents of those messages are also temporarily stored on the devices of recipients. After 24 hours of sitting on our servers, a Public Post will automatically be deleted from our servers and our Services are programmed to delete the Public Post from the Meerchat app on the recipients&#39; devices. Similarly, our Services are programmed to automatically delete a Message Thread after a user and the recipient have seen it and swiped out of the chat screen, unless the recipient that created the Public Post responds to you with a Private Post. This constitutes a Handshake event in which the recipient associated with the Public Post is given a 24-hour window to respond with another Private Post to the solicited user before the Message Thread is terminated. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that deletion of any message always occurs within a particular timeframe. We also cannot prevent others from making copies of your messages (e.g., by taking a screenshot). If we are able to detect that the recipient has captured a screenshot of a Private Post that you send, we will attempt to notify you. In addition, as for any other digital information, there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients&#39; devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted. You should not use Meerchat to send messages if you want to be certain that the recipient cannot keep a copy. </span><span class="c2">Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission&#39;s website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</span></li></ul><ol class="c6 lst-kix_x30y0fqts4bu-0" start="7"><li class="c13"><span class="c0">Information you provide about yourself while using our Service</span></li></ol><ul class="c6 lst-kix_x4ip6pgpumqk-0 start"><li class="c10"><span class="c2">We provide areas on our Service where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others.

For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.</span></li></ul><ol class="c6 lst-kix_x30y0fqts4bu-0" start="8"><li class="c13"><span class="c0">Children&#39;s privacy</span></li></ol><ul class="c6 lst-kix_33anjeplij3a-0 start"><li class="c10"><span class="c2">Although our Service is a general audience Service, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above.
